# What is this about?

Centro Ambiental de Caba√ßos has much more electrical power during solar hours, because most of its electricity comes from solar panels.

## Solar Hours:

| Season | Start | End |
| Winter | 09:00 | 16:00 |

# What does this mean?

We need to adapt our usage of electricity to be in rhythm with the sun.

High-power appliances, which use a lot of electricity, should *only* be used during solar hours.

During off-solar hours, they should be turned off or unplugged!

## List of High-Power Appliances:

* Laundry Machines
* Water Heaters (for showers and sinks)
