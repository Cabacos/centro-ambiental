# What is this about?

Centro Ambiental de Caba√ßos has much more electrical power when the sun is shining, because most of its electricity comes from solar panels.

The ten solar panels above Tony's House have a maximum power output of 2500 watts. During the winter, on a cloudy afternoon, this might go down to 125 watts. During the night, they produce no power at all.

# What does this mean?

We need to adapt our usage of electricity to be in rhythm with the sun.

## When the sun is out:

* Use the laundry machines
* Turn the water heaters to high power

## When it's dark:

* Unplug laptops and other high-power devices (more than 20 watts)
* Turn the water heaters to minimum power

# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions):

## How do I know how much power my device uses?

For anything that has a power adapter, like a laptop computer, you can look at the adapter itself. They usually have a label that says the voltage and amperage. For example, a laptop adapter might say "20V / 4.25A max". Multiply the voltage and amperage together to find the wattage. 20V * 4.25A = 85W.
