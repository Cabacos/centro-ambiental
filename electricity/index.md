# Electricity Usage

Centro Ambiental de Caba√ßos has much more electrical power when the sun is shining, because most of its electricity comes from solar panels.

The ten solar panels above Tony's House have a maximum power output of 2500 watts. During the winter, on a cloudy afternoon, this might go down to 125 watts. During the night, they produce no power at all.

There are no batteries. Extra power from the solar panels is given back to the grid.

Since the whole place is connected to the grid with only one meter, using too much electricity at night can easily overstress the system, causing a local power-out. When this happens, Manu has to go and turn it on again by hand.

## What does this mean?

We need to adapt our usage of electricity to be in rhythm with the sun.

To achieve this, we pooled our knowledge into a list of best practices.

## How do we do it?

### We don't waste electricity.

### We turn the lights off when not needed.
We use our best judgement. We don't turn the lights off when we're just going to the neighbor's for a couple minutes.

*Note from Spencer: I turn the lights off even if I'll only be out for ten seconds. Some people think it uses more energy to turn the lights on and off, so they leave the lights on in a room if they know they'll be back in a couple minutes. However, this is a myth. In reality, it always saves energy to turn the lights off. See [this two-minute video](http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/mythbusters/videos/lights-on-or-off-minimyth/).*

### We turn the water heaters off in the evening.
We look at the sun to decide when it's "evening", not at the clock.

Cheva, Odeth, Ohr and Maya turn the water heater off a little later, because they need more hot water for showers in the evening. (A bigger water tank would help this.)

### We inform Manu, Anjay or Hugo when we change our water or power usage.
This means whenever we add a new electrical device or install a new water-using system.

To be practical, we don't inform anyone about low-power devices, like lightbulbs and laptops, unless we plug in more than 500 watts total.

### We always buy low-energy lightbulbs.
When we talked about this on 2017-02-20, we discovered that lightbulbs are a complex issue. For example, we weren't able to answer the question: is it ecological to replace all the bulbs, before they burn out by themselves?

To find out what Odeth will do research.

### We wash our clothes consciously.
The half-hour setting on the laundry machines is almost always enough to get the clothes clean.

Cheva and Spencer will make a sign to put on the laundry machines.

## Who agrees? (2017-02-20)

* Anjay
* Cheva
* Diego
* Luna
* Manu
* Maya
* Odeth
* Ohr
* Spencer

*Note from Spencer: I made this list from memory, and I forgot at least one person's name. Sorry!*

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions):

### How do I know how much power my device uses?

For anything that has a power adapter, like a laptop computer, you can look at the adapter itself. They usually have a label that says the voltage and amperage. For example, a laptop adapter might say "20V / 4.25A max". Multiply the voltage and amperage together to find the wattage. 20V * 4.25A = 85W.
