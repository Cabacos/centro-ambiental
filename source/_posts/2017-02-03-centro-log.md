# Dreaming Cycle

## Spencer

In my night's dreams, Cedric is my life coach and he's telling me his observations about me. He has doubts about the effectiveness of what I'm doing, but he can see it's the right thing for me to do, because right now the most important area of life for me to develop is love-and-sexuality.

While I listen to him, I mostly look at my naked feet. My toes have wet clay between them. As I squish it around, it looks as if some of it is forming into the shape of a new toe, in a gap between the old ones. I'm not sure whether it's a fifth or sixth toe, or whether I'll keep it.

In my big dream, my life expectancy is growing faster than my age, and this is normal in my culture. I live in Bacia Sado, the seven thousand square kilometer water basin of the Sado river. It's a lush ecosystem holding 35 million human beings. Looking out into the world, I see various places in better and worse states of being than Bacia Sado, and in the total picture it's clear that life on Earth is rapidly gaining health and wellbeing. Physical violence is already so rare as to be virtually nonexistent, and consciousness is still rising.

In my day's dreams, we developed the dreaming, planning and celebrating cycles further, so that all four cycles are palpably in balance, and by the time we went to bed there were no loose ends left.

We set up my computer, so I could answer email from the Grace Foundation, Andrea and PHM. We decided when PHM should be invited to come to Cabacos, and how Cedric, Diego and I want to relate to him, in the near term.

I talked with Cedric and Diego about the culture repo I'm developing (where this document itself lives), and they got excited by a glimpse of how I envision the process of open source cultural development.

I talked with Manu during our trip in the afternoon, about dharma, social structures, and the transmission and transformation of culture, beginning with the question, "How will my organization of the kitchen be fixed?" We agreed that only change is permanent. He showed interest in ideas from Sociocracy 3.0, and he decided he'll join when we invite Andrea to introduce us to it.

(Also: I wrote this before our common start, and forgot to take notes when we were actually sharing! Whoops! <Spencer)
