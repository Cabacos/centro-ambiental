# Dreaming Circle

Ideas from Spencer:
* Develop the dreaming circle (begin with the night's dreams, then the big dream, move toward the day's dreams)
* Develop the planning circle (establish kanban)
* Develop the celebrating circle (performances?)
* Need to set up computer for answering email (especially relevant: Grace Foundation, Andrea and PHM)
* Decide on PHM
* Git Page
* Post a living document for the Centro Ambiental treasury
* Continue kitchen reorganization
* Ask Diego about his tahini contribution (Does he want Centro Ambiental to reimburse him?)
* Talk with Manu (dharma, social structures, transmission and transformation of culture)
* Centro Ambiental circle (responsible for the space and meals)
